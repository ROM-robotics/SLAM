## What is SLAM?
Simultaneous Localization And Mapping is considered a fundamental problem for any autonomously navigating system. Such a system - mostly, a robot - will need to perceive the environment around it (mapping) and at the same time, answer the question "Where am I in my map?" (localization). Hence, SLAM has become an integral part of robotics. 

## Theory
The Mathematics behind the heart of SLAM algorithms include Probability theory and Bayesian and Markov methods. Depending on the specifics of the SLAM algorithm, knowledge of several other techniques may also be required - for example, the GraphSLAM (or LeastSquares SLAM) requires knowledge of graph theory.

## About the course
Robot Mapping by Dr.Cyrill Stachniss introduces several SLAM Algorithms in sufficient detail so as to facilitate implementation.
The primary textbook for the course is "Probabilistic Robotics" by Thrun et.al.

## Software Used
Octave on Ubuntu was used to code the SLAM algorithms. The code should be compatible with MATLAB also. However, it has not been tested.

## Results
The video / plot results are in the 'plots' folder in each corresponding algorithm folder.
